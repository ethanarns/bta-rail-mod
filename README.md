# Railty Lite
Ever wanted to make more rails, but just didn't have the resources?
Want to retrieve farm drops via rail?
This is what you're looking for. (It's pronounced Rail-Tie)

A very simple upgrade for rail addicts. My first BTA mod!

### Features
- Chest minecarts now pick up nearby items
- Rails and Powered Rail default recipes produce twice the output
- An easier Powered Rail recipe that doesn't need gold added
